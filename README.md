## Introduction
This repository contains the code and data for my internship project in data science. The goal of this project is to predict the Revenue of a Restaurant based on given features.

## Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed raw restaurant data sourced from Kaggle, performing data cleaning and visualization to gain deeper insights. Utilizing built-in models from scikit-learn, I predicted revenues based on the given features and evaluated the models to determine the best results. The main steps include:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Model Building and Training
5. Model Evaluation
6. Results/Predictions
