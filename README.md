## Introduction
This repository contains the code and data for my internship project in data science. The goal of this project is to predict the Revenue of a Restaurant based on given features.

## Project Overview
In this project, I explored the raw restaurant data which was collected through kaggle and performed analysis, data cleaning and data visualizations to understand the data better. Then I used the in-built models from scikit-learn to predict the Revenues based on the given features and evaluated them in order to identify the best results. The main steps include:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Model Building and Training
5. Model Evaluation
6. Results/Predictions
